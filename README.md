##Abstract
A portable cardiac monitoring system is crucial in daily life due to the rising prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which are the leading cause of death worldwide. Early detection and consistent monitoring of cardiac health can significantly reduce the risk of severe complications such as heart attacks or strokes. Traditional hospital-based monitoring systems are often inaccessible in remote or underprivileged areas and inconvenient for continuous, long-term use. A portable system bridges this gap by offering real-time tracking of vital parameters like ECG, heart rate, and oxygen levels, empowering individuals to monitor their health from the comfort of their homes. This not only enhances patient outcomes through timely intervention but also reduces the burden on healthcare facilities. This project presents the design and implementation of a portable cardiac monitoring system using the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller. The system integrates an AD8232 ECG sensor, MAX30102 Heart-Rate/Spo2 sensor to monitor and display real-time ECG signals, Heart-Rate/Oxygen Level on an OLED display. This project report discusses the hardware configuration, software development, and challenges encountered, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for real-time cardiac monitoring.
